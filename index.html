There are dozens of languages with 10+ million speakers, but 1000's with less than even 2000 speakers in the whole world. 


Languages were lost earlier because of oral tradition, some did not transition into print era. Today 100s may be lost if not enabled in digital era.


Enabling Indic Languages digitally is our mission!
